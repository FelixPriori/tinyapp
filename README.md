# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). The app generates a random string of character which it assigns to the url. When the shortened url is used, it will redirect to the long url. Additionally, the app provides some statistics about each URLs to the user. Namely, the creation date, the number of visits, and the number of unique visitors. URLs can only be edited or deleted by the user. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt and cookies are encrypted with cookie-session to ensure security for the user.

This app was made by Felix Rioux Sabourin in February 2020, on week 3 of [Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.ca/)' 12 weeks web bootcamp.
